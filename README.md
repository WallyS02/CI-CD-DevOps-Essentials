## If I'll find any other feature to be useful - it'll surely be added!
## How it works?
CI/CD is essentially automating processes between dev and ops teams.
* Continuous Integration \(CI\) focuses on frequent code changes merges to its main version \(main/master branch\), detecting bugs by building code and running automated tests \(on this stage usually unit, integration tests and linting with SAST\). Code is integrated faster than manually and everything that can be automated is automated.
* CD can be interpreted as Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment. Continuous Delivery means that end result of pipeline is a production-ready, built and fully tested \(in different environments\) code that can be deployed anytime, e.g. after manual confirmation. Continuous Deployment extends Continuous Delivery by involving automatic deployment to production environment.

CI/CD practises shorten integrations, deliveries or deployments from really long time to even minutes if designed and implemented correctly. Whole process is consistent and closely monitored, problems and bugs are detected earlier by shifting testing to the left.
